This is a test git file for cohort 8. The expectation is that at the end of this lecture we would have:
1. Refreshed our memory from the last class
2. Learnt about git branches
3. Open a git repository
4. Push our code from the local repository to the remote repository
We are adding a new line to this file
Git is an interesting course to learn
Showing the head changes
Adding a new line of text from bugfix master
Its a bright and sunny day
We are adding this new line from the GUI
